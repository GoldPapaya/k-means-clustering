This project applies k-means clustering to segment data from a popular wine dataset, which was originally introduced by Aberhard et al. in their 1994 study, <a href='https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Comparative-analysis-of-statistical-pattern-methods-Aeberhard-Coomans/83dc3e4030d7b9fbdbb4bde03ce12ab70ca10528' target='_blank'> Comparative Analysis of Statistical Pattern Recognition Methods in High Dimensional Settings.</a>
